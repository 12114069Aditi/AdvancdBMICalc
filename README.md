# Advanced BMI Calculator
The **Advanced BMI Calculator** is a Python-based graphical application designed to calculate and classify Body Mass Index (BMI) interactively. This user-friendly tool provides an intuitive interface where users can input their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) using sliders or manual input fields. Upon calculation, the application dynamically displays the BMI value along with its corresponding health classification, such as "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight," or "Obese." Each category includes a personalized health message to help users better understand their results and take appropriate actions if needed.
This project is developed using Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface and the PIL (Pillow) library for handling dynamic image resizing. The sliders are styled with Tkinter’s `ttk` module to ensure smooth and visually appealing user interactions. The BMI is calculated using the standard formula: **BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m)²)**. The application features a dynamic height visualization using a resizable image, making it engaging and easy to interpret.
The Advanced BMI Calculator is designed with a focus on usability and visual aesthetics. It provides real-time updates, ensuring users can see their BMI value and health classification instantly after adjusting the sliders or inputs. The tool includes clear categorizations based on BMI ranges, such as "Underweight" (≤ 18.5), "Normal" (18.5–24.9), "Overweight" (25.0–29.9), and "Obese" (≥ 30.0), with tailored health advice for each category.
To run this project, users need Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries (`tkinter` and `Pillow`). The application can be launched by running the `main.py` file in the terminal or IDE, ensuring that all image assets (e.g., `bmiimage1.png`, `top.png`, `box.png`, `scale.png`, `man.png`) are correctly placed in an `images/` folder within the project directory.
